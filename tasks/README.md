# Implementation Tasks

This directory contains a breakdown of the development tasks required to implement `pgtls`. The tasks are designed to be completed sequentially, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Each document outlines a specific piece of functionality to be built and the testing strategy that should be used to validate it.

The overall implementation plan is as follows:

1.  **[Task 001: Project Setup and Configuration](./001-project-setup-and-config.md)**: Define core data structures and test configuration parsing.
2.  **[Task 002: Protocol Parsing](./002-protocol-parsing.md)**: Implement and test the `SSLRequest` detection logic.
3.  **[Task 003: Connection Handler (TLS-to-Plaintext)](./003-connection-handler-tls-to-plaintext.md)**: Build and test the core proxying logic for TLS termination.
4.  **[Task 004: Connection Handler (TLS-to-TLS)](./004-connection-handler-tls-to-tls.md)**: Extend the handler to support TLS re-origination.
5.  **[Task 005: Integration Testing](./005-integration-testing.md)**: Build the end-to-end test suite.
6.  **[Task 006: Application Assembly](./006-application-main-and-logging.md)**: Create the final application binary, including logging and graceful shutdown.
